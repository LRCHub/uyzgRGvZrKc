It's a check

I'm not selfish, I can not help it
Body look good, even better when I felt it
Body like soul food, suck you like shellfish
Murder on my mind now, I am not Melvin
Prolly need a lawyer, prolly need a bails man
You the whole package, you don't need a salesman
Hot like Celsius, hot like Kelvin
I let you steal my whole rock like Elvis
Come have it, bust down in Balenci'
You a bad B, twenty one and naked, you a savage
If you let me ah-ah, I'ma stab it
Put Chanel-y on your back, gotta have it
I'm about self care, 20 K in that Telfar, I usеd to be on wealth fare
Shе been givin' me that look
Might as well put some money on a nigga book
'Cause I know

I'm gettin' locked up
I know I'm gettin' locked up, body gettin' locked up
She gettin' locked up, she know we gettin' locked up
We gettin' locked up
I know, I should go back to the streets
But I gotta get my peace, that "Ah" gon' die by me
I'ma kill it every time, I'ma catch a body in here
I'ma catch a body if I hit it wrong
Lookin' like that, I'ma catch a body in here
I'ma catch a body if I hit him when he lookin' like that
Smell a homi' in the air
I'ma catch a body if he lookin' like that when I hit yeah
Just give me the word, I'ma pull over on this curb, let's spray that-

Count up dog shit, pourin' up darkness
Sippin' on Belaire, stearin' in a starship
Mob stick in the backseat, it's a war ship
Fuck the police, fuck the law, livin' lawless
Black boy joy, every season I'm flawless
I'm the reason why these niggas hate it, and they all pissed
Glock pocket watchin' my bag, and came for y'all kids
Got a dangerous mind, I'm coldhearted
I don't know if it's the history curvin' on my mind
When I think about that, I got murder on my mind
Hey, Kiki, keep clarity VV, I'm rippin' it TC
I'm stuck in these day heads, buildin' a Tiki
Really not a problem when you wanna come see me
Just drop up in it, I'ma spin a bend
Keep it player, I'm not tryna put no hands on you
I'm just tryna put these bands on you, yeah, still

I'm gettin' locked up
I know I'm gettin' locked up, body gettin' locked up
She gettin' locked up, she know we gettin' locked up
We gettin' locked up
I know, I should go back to the streets
But I gotta get my peace, that "Ah" gon' die by me
I'ma kill it every time, I'ma catch a body in here
I'ma catch a body if I hit it wrong
Lookin' like that, I'ma catch a body in here
I'ma catch a body if I hit him when he lookin' like that
Smell a homi' in the air
I'ma catch a body if he lookin' like that when I hit yeah
Just give me the word, I'ma pull over on this curb, let's spray that
Brr
